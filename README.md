# Marvel App Redo

Simple SPA using vanillia JavaScript (ES6), PostCSS, Babel, ESLint and Parcel Bundler. The purpose of this project was less about the final result and more getting familar with modern front end tools.

To see the page so far, you'll need an key to access the Marvel API. Once you have it, clone this repo and `npm i`, enter `parcel index.html` in your console, go to `http://localhost:1234`.

This app is a work in progress.
